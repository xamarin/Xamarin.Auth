# Overview

# The execution environment is the set of environment variables and Android 
# system properties that influence program execution. Android system properties 
# can be set with the adb shell setprop command, while environment variables can 
# be set by setting the debug.mono.env system property:

# Enable GREF logging

#    adb shell setprop debug.mono.log gref

# Set the MONO_LOG_LEVEL and MONO_LOG_MASK environment variables, so that additional 
# Mono messages will be written to `adb logcat`.

#    adb shell setprop debug.mono.env "'MONO_LOG_LEVEL=info|MONO_LOG_MASK=asm'"

# Android system properties are set for all processes on the target device.

# Starting with Xamarin.Android 4.6, both system properties and environment 
# variables may be set or overridden on a per-app basis by adding an environment 
# file to the project. An environment file is a Unix-formatted plain-text file 
# with a Build action of AndroidEnvironment. The environment file contains lines 
# with the format key=value. Comments are lines which start with #. 
# Blank lines are ignored.

# If key starts with an uppercase letter, then key is treated as an environment 
# variable and setenv(3) is used to set the environment variable to the specified 
# value during process startup.

# If key starts with a lowercase letter, then key is treated as an Android system 
# property and value is the default value: Android system properties which control 
# Xamarin.Android execution behavior are looked up first from the Android system 
# property server, and if no value is present then the value specified in the 
# environment file is used. This is to permit adb shell setprop to be used to 
# override values which come from the environment file for diagnostic purposes.

# Xamarin.Android Environment Variables

# Xamarin.Android supports the following enviornment variables, which may be set
# either via adb shell setprop debug.mono.env or via the $(AndroidEnvironment) 
# Build action.

# XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE

# The assembly-qualified type which must inherit from HttpMessageHandler and is 
# constructed from the HttpClient() default constructor.

# In Xamarin.Android 6.1, this environment variable is not set by default, and 
# HttpClientHandler will be used.

# Alternatively, the value Xamarin.Android.Net.AndroidClientHandler may be 
# specified to use java.net.URLConnection for network access, which may permit 
# use of TLS 1.2 when Android supports it.

# Added in Xamarin.Android 6.1.


# Xamarin.Android System Properties

# Xamarin.Android supports the following system properties, which may be set 
# either via adb shell setprop or via the $(AndroidEnvironment) Build action.

#		debug.mono.debug
#		debug.mono.env
#		debug.mono.gc
#		debug.mono.log
#		debug.mono.max_grefc
#		debug.mono.profile
#		debug.mono.runtime_args
#		debug.mono.trace
#		debug.mono.wref
#		XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE

# debug.mono.debug:

# The value of the debug.mono.debug system property is an integer. If 1, then 
# behave "as if" the process were started with mono --debug. This generally shows 
# file and line information in stack traces, etc., without requiring that the app 
# be started from a debugger.

# debug.mono.env:

# Contains a |-separated list of environment variables.

# debug.mono.gc:

# The value of the debug.mono.debug system property is an integer. If 1, then GC 
#information should be logged.

# This is equivalent to having the debug.mono.log system property contain gc.

# debug.mono.log:

# Controls which additional information Xamarin.Android will log to adb logcat. 
# It is a , -separated string, containing one of the following values:

# all: 
#	Print out all messages. This is seldom a good idea, as it includes lref 
# 	messages.
# assembly: 
#	Print out .apk and assembly parsing messages.
# gc: 
#	Print out GC-related messages.
# gref: 
#	Print out JNI Global Reference messages.
# lref: 
#	Print out JNI Local Reference messages.
#Note: This will really spam adb logcat.

# In Xamarin.Android 5.1, this will also create a .__override__/lrefs.txt file, 
# which can get gigantic.
# Avoid.

# timing: Print out some method timing information. This will also create the 
#files .__override__/methods.txt and .__override__/counters.txt.

# debug.mono.max_grefc:
# The value of the debug.mono.max_grefc system property is an integer. It's 
# value overrides the default detected maximum GREF count for the target device.

# Please note: This is only usable with adb shell setprop debug.mono.max_grefc 
# as the value will not be available in time with an environment.txt file.

# debug.mono.profile:

# The debug.mono.profile system property enables the profiler. It is equivalent 
# to, and uses the same values as, the mono --profile option. (See the mono(1) 
# man page for more information.)

# debug.mono.runtime_args:

# The debug.mono.runtime_args system property contains additional options that 
# should be parsed by mono.

# debug.mono.trace:

# The debug.mono.trace system property enables tracing. It is equivalent to, 
# and uses the same values as, the mono --trace option. (See the mono(1) man 
# page for more information.)

# In general, do not use. Use of tracing will spam adb logcat output, severaly 
# slow down program behavior, and alter program behavior (up to and including 
# adding additional error conditions).

# Sometimes, however, it allows some additional investigation to be performed...

# debug.mono.wref:

# The debug.mono.wref system property allows overriding the default detected 
# JNI Weak Reference mechanism. There are two supported values:
# jni: 
#	Use JNI weak references, as created by JNIEnv::NewWeakGlobalRef() and 
#	destroyed by JNIEnv::DeleteWeakGlobalREf().
# java: 
#	Use JNI Global references which reference java.lang.WeakReference instances.
#	java is used, by default, up through API-7 and on API-19 (Kit Kat) with ART 
#	enabled. (API-8 added jni references, and ART broke jni references.)

# This system property is useful for testing and certain forms of investigation. 
# In general, it should not be changed.

# XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE
# First introduced in Xamarin.Android 6.1, this environment variable declares 
# the default HttpMessageHandler implementation that will be used by the 
# HttpClient. By default this variable is not set, and Xamarin.Android will use 
# the HttpClientHandler.
# XA_HTTP_CLIENT_HANDLER_TYPE=Xamarin.Android.Net.AndroidClientHandler
# The underlying Android device must support TLS 1.2. Android 5.0 and later 
# support TLS 1.2

# Clear out a Mono environment variable to decrease logging

# Xamarin / Mono: Android adb tracing / debug logging
# adb shell setprop debug.checkjni 1
# adb shell setprop debug.mono.env MONO_LOG_LEVEL=info
